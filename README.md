## Background  
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: 
http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har
 (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).    

## Data   
The training data for this project are available here: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project come from this source: 
http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har
. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment. 

## Analysis

First, we load some useful packages using: 
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(rattle)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(corrplot)
library(randomForest)
library(RColorBrewer)
```  

## Getting Data  
First of all, we need to set current working directory.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
setwd("~/GitHub/Practical-Machine-Learning-Johns-Hopkins-Bloomberg-School-of-Public-Health-Coursera/Project")
```  

The following code fragment downloads the dataset to the `data` folder in the current working directory.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
trainUrl <-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
trainFile <- "./data/pml-training.csv"
testFile  <- "./data/pml-testing.csv"
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
  dir.create("./data")
}
if (!file.exists(trainFile)) {
  download.file(trainUrl, destfile = trainFile, method = "curl")
}
if (!file.exists(testFile)) {
  download.file(testUrl, destfile = testFile, method = "curl")
}
rm(trainUrl)
rm(testUrl)
```  

## Reading Data  
After downloading the data from the data source, we can read the two csv files into two data frames.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
trainRaw <- read.csv(trainFile)
testRaw <- read.csv(testFile)
dim(trainRaw)
dim(testRaw)
rm(trainFile)
rm(testFile)
```  
The training data set contains `r dim(trainRaw)[1]` observations and `r dim(trainRaw)[2]` variables, while the testing data set contains `r dim(testRaw)[1]` observations and `r dim(testRaw)[2]` variables. The `classe` variable in the training set is the outcome to predict.  

## Cleaning Data  
Now we will clean the data, to get rid of observations with missing values, NA and unwanted values.  

1. Cleaning the <b>Near Zero Variance</b> Variables.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
NZV <- nearZeroVar(trainRaw, saveMetrics = TRUE)
head(NZV, 20)
training01 <- trainRaw[, !NZV$nzv]
testing01 <- testRaw[, !NZV$nzv]
dim(training01)
dim(testing01)
rm(trainRaw)
rm(testRaw)
rm(NZV)
```  

2. Removing not required vbalues.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
regex <- grepl("^X|timestamp|user_name", names(training01))
training <- training01[, !regex]
testing <- testing01[, !regex]
rm(regex)
rm(training01)
rm(testing01)
dim(training)
dim(testing)
```  

3. Removing NA values`.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
cond <- (colSums(is.na(training)) == 0)
training <- training[, cond]
testing <- testing[, cond]
rm(cond)
```  

Now, the cleaned training data set contains `r dim(training)[1]` observations and `r dim(training)[2]` variables, while the testing data set contains `r dim(testing)[1]` observations and `r dim(testing)[2]` variables.  

Correlation Matrix of Columns in the Training Data set.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
corrplot(cor(training[, -length(names(training))]), method = "color", tl.cex = 0.5)
```  

## Partitioning Training dataset into training (70%) and validation (30%)
The validation dataset will be used to conduct cross validation later. 
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p = 0.70, list = FALSE)
validation <- training[-inTrain, ]
training <- training[inTrain, ]
rm(inTrain)
```  
The Dataset now consists of `r dim(training)[2]` variables with the observations divided as following:  
1. Training Data: `r dim(training)[1]` observations.  
2. Validation Data: `r dim(validation)[1]` observations.  
3. Testing Data: `r dim(testing)[1]` observations.  

## Data Modelling  

### Decision Tree  
We fit a predictive model for activity recognition using <b>Decision Tree</b> algorithm.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
modelTree <- rpart(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "class")
prp(modelTree)
```  

### Random Forest
We fit a predictive model for activity recognition using <b>Random Forest</b> algorithm because it automatically selects important variables and is robust to correlated covariates & outliers in general.  
We will use <b>5-fold cross validation</b> when applying the algorithm.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
modelRF <- train(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "rf", trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", 5), ntree = 250)
modelRF
```  

The Estimated Accuracy of the Random Forest Model is `r accuracy[1]*100`% and the Estimated Out-of-Sample Error is `r ose*100`%.  
Random Forests yielded better Results, as expected!  

## Predicting The Manner of Exercise for Test Data Set  
Now, we apply the <b>Random Forest</b> model to the original testing data set downloaded from the data source. We remove the problem_id column first.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
rm(accuracy)
rm(ose)
predict(modelRF, testing[, -length(names(testing))])
```
